Booking.com Scraper  Bot
********************

The Booking.com Scraper Bot is a simple bot that will use Selenium to open Booking.com and ask you a few questions 
to customize the trip you're looking for. 

The prompts will then populate the search parameters on Booking.com and export the trips that fit your criteria 
onto the screen with their prices. 

To operate the bot, simply run the run.py file. 

Happy scraping!
